# Email-Greeting-Generator
Python Email greeting generator
This is a simple Python email greeting generator which allows me to easily produce a email greeting depending on the selection I choose from the command line menu.  

The program asks the user to select one of the options available, providing further information regarding name, subject etc.  It then copies the text to users clipboard so it can be pasted into an email.
